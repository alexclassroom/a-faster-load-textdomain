# A Faster load_textdomain

This is a WordPress plugin that caches the `.mo` file in a transient to speed up the loading of text domains.

## Prerequisites

WordPress 6.3, I'm using the `pre_load_textdomain` filter, or later.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin files and extract `wp-cache-textdomain.php` to the `wp-content/mu-plugins` directory.
2. Optional, add an object cache to your WordPress installation.

## Usage

The plugin automatically caches the `.mo` file in a transient when it is loaded, and retrieves the cached data when the same file is loaded again. This speeds up the loading of text domains in WordPress.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I add an object cache?

You can add an object cache by installing a caching plugin like

- [W3 Total Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/)
- [Redis Object Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/redis-cache/)
- [Object Cache Pro](https://objectcache.pro/)

I use Object Cache Pro, it's a premium plugin, but it's worth every penny.
