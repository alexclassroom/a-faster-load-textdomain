# A Faster load_textdomain

> **NOTE** This plugin is not needed if you are running WordPress 6.5 or later, as the functionality [is built into WordPress core](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/02/27/i18n-improvements-6-5-performant-translations/). If you need to generate translation in the new <code>.l10n.php</code> format, use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/performant-translations/">Performant Translations</a> plugin instead.

This is a WordPress plugin that caches the .mo file as an PHP array, and [include](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.include.php) the array instead of the .mo file. In theory, nothing is faster in PHP than loading and executing another PHP file.

## Installation

Either (recommended):

- Download the plugin files and extract `a-faster-load-textdomain.php` and `class-afld-cachehandler.php` to the `wp-content/mu-plugins` directory.

Or:

- Search for "[A faster load_textdomain](https://wordpress.org/plugins/a-faster-load-textdomain/)" and install with the WordPress plugin installer.
- (Network) Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

It's also possible to install the plugin via Composer: `composer require soderlind/a-faster-load-textdomain`

## How It Works

If you have a plugin or theme that loads a textdomain, e.g. `load_textdomain( 'textdomain', $path_to_mo_file )`, then this plugin will:

1. Look for a PHP version of the .mo file in `WP_CONTENT_DIR . '/cache/a-faster-load-textdomain'` directory.
2. If the PHP version exists, [include](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.include.php) the file.
3. If the PHP version doesn't exist, load the .mo file, and save the file as an PHP array in `wp-content/cache/a-faster-load-textdomain/` directory.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Look for PHP version of .mo file in cache directory}
    B -->|Exists| C[Include the PHP file]
    B -->|Doesn't Exist| D[Load the .mo file]
    D --> E[Save the file as a PHP array in cache directory]
    C --> F[End]
    E --> F[End]
```

The localized PHP array can be cached via [PHP OPcache](http://blog.jpauli.tech/2015-03-05-opcache-html/). If you have PHP OPcache enabled, then the localized PHP array will be cached in memory, and the PHP file will not be parsed again.

## Filters

### `a_faster_load_textdomain_cache_path`

Change the cache path, default is `WP_CONTENT_DIR . '/cache/a-faster-load-textdomain'`.

```php
add_filter( 'a_faster_load_textdomain_cache_path', function( $path ) {
	return WP_CONTENT_DIR . '/cache/my-cache';
} );
```
