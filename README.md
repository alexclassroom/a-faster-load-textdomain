# A Faster load_textdomain

This is a WordPress plugin that caches the `.mo` file in a transient to speed up the loading of text domains.

## Prerequisites

WordPress 6.3 or later

## Installation

Download the plugin files and extract `wp-cache-textdomain.php` to the `wp-content/mu-plugins` directory.

## Usage

The plugin automatically caches the `.mo` file in a transient when it is loaded, and retrieves the cached data when the same file is loaded again. This speeds up the loading of text domains in WordPress.
