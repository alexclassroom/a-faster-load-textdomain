# A Faster load_textdomain

This is a WordPress plugin that caches the .mo file as an PHP array, and [include](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.include.php) the array instead of the .mo file. In theory, nothing is faster in PHP than loading and executing another PHP file.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin files and extract `a-faster-load-textdomain.php` to the `wp-content/mu-plugins` directory.

## How It Works

If you have a plugin or theme that loads a textdomain, e.g. `load_textdomain( 'textdomain', $path_to_mo_file )`, then this plugin will:

1. Look for a PHP version of the .mo file in `WP_CONTENT_DIR . '/cache/a-faster-load-textdomain'` directory.
2. If the PHP version exists, [include](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.include.php) the file.
3. If the PHP version doesn't exist, load the .mo file, and save the file as an PHP array in `wp-content/cache/a-faster-load-textdomain/` directory.

The localized PHP array can be cached via [PHP OPcache](http://blog.jpauli.tech/2015-03-05-opcache-html/). If you have PHP OPcache enabled, then the localized PHP array will be cached in memory, and the PHP file will not be parsed again.
